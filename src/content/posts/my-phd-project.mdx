In homage to the Ig Nobel prize [24/7 lectures](https://improbable.com/ig/24-7-2/), here is my PhD topic.

> First, a complete, technical description, in 24 seconds\
> Then, a clear summary that anyone can understand, in 7 words

## In 24 seconds

{/* 60-66 words */}

Rising seas will affect millions. What will Antarctica do as the world heats? What *did* it do last time Earth got warm? Was there ice in the middle of West Antarctica?

Icebergs carry sand grains from under the ice out to sea. I track them back with their isotope fingerprints and find where the ice was millions of years ago. Plug that into a model, *et voil√°*!*

## In 7 words

Seabed sand fingerprints reconstruct ancient ice sheets.

*Significantly simplified (obviously). Maybe not even true, but I hope it will be... watch this space!

## The detail

West Antarctica -- Ice sheet stability -- future sea level rise -- marine sediment provenance -- laser ablation -- lead isotopes in detrital feldspars */}
