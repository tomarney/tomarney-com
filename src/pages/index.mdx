I’m both a geologist and an oceanographer. I go to sea on research ships for weeks or months at a time, drilling into the seafloor to collect rocks and sediments.

I use these materials to investigate whether the ice sheet that covers West Antarctica has disappeared in the last few million years. If it has, the effects of climate change mean it might be at risk of collapsing again, raising global sea levels by up to 5 metres – and inundating coastal cities including New York, Shanghai, and Mumbai.
