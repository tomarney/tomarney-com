# About this site

This is a static website generated using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The theme is my own, built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The site is in a [public repo](https://github.com/tomarney/tomarney-com) on GitHub - feel free to fork it or use the [template](https://github.com/tomarney/astro-tailwind-blog) (a link back to my homepage would be nice if you do!)

If you notice a bug or anything wrong, please tell me directly or [create an issue](https://github.com/tomarney/tomarney-com/issues/new/choose) on the repo.
