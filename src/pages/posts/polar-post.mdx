# Polar Post: Letters from Antarctica

In January and February 2022, I set out on my first research expedition, to East Antarctica aboard the German research icebreaker *[Polarstern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Polarstern)*.

To keep my family and friends updated with how it went I sent a series of plain text emails (all I could do with our spotty communications) at a rate of about one per week. When I got back, I added them here, with photos taken at the time.
