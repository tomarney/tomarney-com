# Biography

I am a PhD candidate at the National Oceanography Centre, University of Southampton, and the British Antarctic Survey. I also have previous professional software development experience.

My current research interests are in polar and climate science using climate proxies in marine sediments. I'm particularly interested in what the provenance of marine sediments can tell us about past climate. I’m also really interested in data visualisation, visual communication, and design.

When I’m not working, you'll find me outside: running, cycling (road and gravel), trekking, wild swimming, sailing, SUP, kayaking, or climbing.
