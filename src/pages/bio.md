# Biography

I am a Research Fellow (postdoc) at the National Oceanography Centre, University of Southampton. I also have previous professional software development experience.

My research interests revolve around using geochemical tracers for past climate reconstructions.

I'm also a self-confessed Pythonista: whenever I've come across existing spreadsheet-based or manual processes in my research, I've replaced them with rigorous and reproducible code, from [processing mass spectrometer data](https://github.com/tomarney/icpmsprocess) to using machine learning algorithms to [reproducibly cluster](/publications/egu-2024-west-antarctic-laser-lead/) isotopic data.
I'm a big fan of the open source ecosystem, and I've contributed to the excellent [TACtool](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/tactool) and [pyleoclim](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util) projects.

Data visualisation, visual communication, and design are a passion of mine, with a few competitions and prizes to my name. I'm quite nerdy about typography too…

When I’m not working, you'll find me being a dad, outside, or both: running, cycling (road and gravel), trekking, wild swimming, sailing, SUP, kayaking, or climbing.
